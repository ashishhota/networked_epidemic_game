# networked_epidemic_game
The impact of game theoretic protection adoption on the spread of epidemics on networks is explored here. The code to generate numerical results presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03126 is made available in this repository. The figures are generated using the https://github.com/masumhabib/PlotPub repository.
